Red Bright:
Typical current = 10 mA
Peak = 20 mA
Typical voltage on 20mA = 2.1
Max voltage on 20 mA = 2.8


On Arduino I have to use GND
As stated max current is 20mA and voltages are with that.
Each output will be 5V.

So I need to subtract from 5V the typical voltage of 2.1V

Typical: 5V - 2.1V = 2.9V
Max: 5V - 2.8V = 2.2V

R = V/I
R Typical= 2.9V / 0.020 = 145 Ohm
R Max = 2.2V / 0.020 = 110
